# jQuery TodoMVC Example

> We refactored this classic to-do list for a class assignment on working with GitHub's API. Refactored, the app populates to-do items with issues from a user's GitHub account (where the user is assigned to an issue). Currently, a user must plug in their github personal token to the app.js file; in future refactoring the app will accept a token as string input or via OAuth login.
